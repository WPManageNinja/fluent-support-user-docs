# Forwarding from Microsoft 365 / OWA

Integrating your **Microsoft 365 (Outlook Web Access)** email with **Fluent Support** allows you to automatically convert incoming emails into support tickets. This guide will walk you through the simple process of setting up email forwarding from **OWA** to your **Mailbox** of Fluent Support.


## Forward from Microsoft 365 Outlook Web Access (OWA)

Before starting the procedure, ensure you have followed the first steps; setting up a new Business Inbox in Fluent Support and your Fluent Support Mailbox Address is ready. To learn how to create a Business Inbox and retrieve your forwarding address, please check this [Documentation](/docs/adding-multiple-business-inboxes).


Log in to your **Microsoft 365 Outlook Web Access** by [clicking here](https://outlook.office365.com/). Then, click on the **Gear Icon** located in the top right corner, and a Settings pop-up will appear.

Now, paste the **Mailbox Email Address** you got from the [Email Piping](/docs/email-piping-email-based-support-ticket) settings of **Fluent Support** into the ‘Forward my email to’ field.
Also, we recommend enabling the **Keep a copy of forwarded messages** option.  

Don’t forget to press the **Save** button once you’re done.
