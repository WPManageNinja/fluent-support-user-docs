# WishList Member Integration


---

With the **WishList Member** plugin, you can easily create online courses, launch a monthly membership, sell digital downloads, and many more. **Fluent Support** integrates with **WishList Member** to display an overview of the **Membership** details of a user, including the **Membership Level** and **Membership Status** on the **Ticket Entries** page, who purchases this plugin.

This article will guide you through integrating [**WishList Member**](https://wishlistmember.com/) with **Fluent Support**.

## **WishList Member Purchase Information In Your Ticket** 

You do not need to integrate the **WishList Member** plugin manually with **Fluent Support** ; it happens automatically if the WishList Member plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased the **WishList Member** plugin and the outline of his membership details (Membership Level and Membership Status) has automatically appeared on his ticket.
