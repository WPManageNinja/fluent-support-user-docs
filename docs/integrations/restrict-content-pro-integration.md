# Restrict Content Pro Integration


---

**Restrict Content Pro** lets you create unlimited subscriptions, manage members, track payments, and more. **Fluent Support** integrates with **WishList Member** to display an overview of the **Membership** details of a user, including the **Membership Level,** **Membership Status,** and **Membership Activation Date** on the **Ticket Entries** page, who purchases this plugin.

This article will guide you through integrating [**Restrict Content Pro**](https://restrictcontentpro.com/) with **Fluent Support**.

## **Restrict Connect Pro Purchase Information In Your Ticket** 

You do not need to integrate the **Restrict Content Pro** plugin manually with **Fluent Support** ; it happens automatically if the Restrict Content Pro plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased the **Restrict Connect Pro** plugin and the outline of his membership details (Membership Level, Membership Status, Membership Activation Date) has automatically appeared on his ticket.
