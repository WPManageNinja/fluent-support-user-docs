# BetterDocs Integration


---

**BetterDocs** is a user-friendly documentation and knowledge base plugin that you can integrate with **Fluent Support**. This will allow you to display relevant **Documentation** to the users when they type their issues in the Subject field of the ticket form under the Support Portal.

This article will guide you through integrating [**BetterDocs**](https://betterdocs.co/) with **Fluent Support**.

## BetterDocs Integration With FluentSupport 

To integrate **BetterDocs** into **FluentSupport** , follow the steps with screenshots below —

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure the BetterDocs integration works, the BetterDocs plugin must be installed and active on your website.

From the **Fluent Support Dashboard**, go to **Settings** and click on **Ticket Form Config** from the left sidebar. This will open the **Ticket Form Settings** page.

### Configuration Steps

* **Enable Suggestions:** Check the box for **Enable knowledge base suggestion on ticket creation form**. This links your knowledge base to the ticket form.
* **Select Post Types:** Under the **Knowledge Base Post Types** section, select **docs**. This option appears because **BetterDocs** uses the 'docs' post type for its articles.
* **Set Article Limit:** In the **Suggested Articles Limit** field, define the maximum number of suggested articles you want to display (e.g., 5 or 15).

Once you have configured these options, do not forget to click the **Save Settings** button in the top right corner.

Now, when a user types keywords into the subject line of a support ticket, the system will automatically search your BetterDocs articles and display relevant documentation suggestions.

This is how the integration of **BetterDocs** with **Fluent Support** works!
