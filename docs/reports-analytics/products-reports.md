# Products Reports

The ‘**Products Reports**’ section breaks down your support volume based on specific products. This is essential for understanding which products generate the most support requests.

## Accessing Products Reports

To access products reports, go to the **Reports** tab from the top menu bar and select **Products Reports** from the left side.

## Filtering and Statistics

 * **Product Filter:** Use the dropdown menu to view statistics for **All Products** or select a specific product (e.g., FluentCRM, Fluent Form) to isolate its data.
 * **Product Statistics Graph:** Shows the number of tickets for each product during the selected date range. You can also view **Ticket Stats**, **Resolve Stats**, and **Response Stats**.

## Product Summary Table

The table at the bottom lists every product configured in your system. It displays:

* **Responses:** Number of replies sent for tickets related to this product.
* **Interactions:** Total touchpoints.
* **Open Tickets:** Current backlog for the product.
* **Closed:** Tickets for this product have been resolved.
