# Bookmark Tickets

Fluent Support allows the support agents to Bookmark their tickets to find them easily on the dashboard or to request another agent to look at a ticket. This article will guide you through the whole process of doing it.

## Bookmarks

First, go to your **Fluent Support** and click on **Tickets**. Now go to your desired ticket section from **My Tickets** , **All Tickets** , **Unassigned** , or **Bookmarks**

Open the specific ticket you want to bookmark and click on the **Bookmark Icon** button.

Now, select **Add Bookmark** and a popup page will appear on the top.

You can assign single or multiple support staff to the ticket using the dropdown list. After selecting the support staff, click the **Add** button and the ticket will be bookmarked & stored under the **Bookmarks** section on the left sidebar.

The **support staff** (agents) will also be **bookmarked** on the right side of that ticket and will shown under the watcher section.
