## Ticket Filtering Sections

Once in the Tickets area, you will find four primary sections in the left sidebar to help organize your workflow:

## Individual Ticket Management

Clicking on any ticket from the list opens the individual ticket page, where you can respond to customers and manage ticket metadata.

### Core Response Tools

* **A) Reply:** Opens the text editor to respond to the customer. You can format text (bold, italic), add links, and use the **Add Media** button to upload files.
* **B) Notes:** Allows agents to leave internal comments that are invisible to the customer. This is ideal for team collaboration and private context.
    * **Send as Informational Reply:** Use this to provide updates without changing the ticket's "Waiting" status.
    * **Reply and Close:** A single action to send your response and immediately resolve the ticket.
* **C) Business Inbox:** Shows and allows you to sort by the specific business brand associated with the ticket.
* **D) Product/Service:** Displays the specific product or service the customer is inquiring about.
* **E) AI Assistant:** Provides options to summarize long conversations and analyze customer satisfaction.
* **F) Ask AI:** Utilize artificial intelligence to draft responses based on the ticket context.
* **G) Templates:** Insert pre-written responses (Saved Replies) to common questions.
* **H) Smart Codes:** Insert dynamic data, such as the customer's name or ticket ID, directly into your reply.
