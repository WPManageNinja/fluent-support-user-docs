This article will guide you through the process required to **create a ticket** for any customer using the **Add Ticket** functionality of Fluent Support. (especially in situations where a customer requests your support staff to open a ticket on their behalf).

## How to Create Tickets on Behalf of the Customer

You can reach your customer here by entering the customer’s name or email address into the search box.

But, if the search fails, you can tick the checkbox **Could not find a contact? Create a new one** to add a new customer to your list.

After clicking the **Create a new one** , you will need to provide the necessary information about the customer and once you are done, click on the **Next** button to proceed. 

From here you can also create a new WordPress user by selecting the **Create New User in WordPress**. To create a new WordPress user you have to give the WordPress username and password for that user.
