# Zendesk Ticket Migrator

Zendesk is a comprehensive SaaS platform for customer service solutions. Fluent Support allows Zendesk users to easily transfer their existing tickets directly into Fluent Support using an API connection. This article will guide you through the migration process.

## Import Tickets From Zendesk 

From the **Fluent Support Dashboard**, go to **Settings** and select **Ticket Importer** from the left sidebar. Find **Zendesk** in the list of migration options and click the **Import Tickets** button.
