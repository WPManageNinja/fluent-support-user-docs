# EDD Integration


---

**Easy Digital Downloads (EDD)** is a platform where you can easily manage store and sell products from WordPress. **Fluent Support** integrates with **EDD** to display a user’s purchase history, including **Product Name, Purchase Status,** and **Product Price** on the **Ticket Entries** page after a user purchases EDD.

This article will guide you through integrating [**Easy Digital Downloads**](https://easydigitaldownloads.com/) with [**Fluent Support**](https://fluentsupport.com/).

## **EDD Product Information in your Ticket** #

You don’t need to perform any integration yourself. It will happen automatically if the **Easy Digital Downloads (EDD)** plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, when a support agent clicks on the **Eye Icon** next to the product price, he/she can view the user’s EDD purchase history with detailed information.
