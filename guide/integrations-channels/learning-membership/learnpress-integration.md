# LearnPress Integration


---

**LearnPress** is also **a WordPress LMS** plugin for e-learning courses; especially, ideal for beginners wanting to launch their first course. **Fluent Support** integrates with **LearnPress** to display an overview of the **Course Purchase History** of any user, including the **Course Nam** e, **Graduation** **Progress** , **Enrollment** **Status** , and **Starting Date** on the **Ticket Entries** page after a user purchases.

This article will guide you through integrating [**LearnPress**](https://thimpress.com/learnpress/) with [**Fluent Support**](https://fluentsupport.com/).

## **LearnPress Purchase Information In Your Ticket** #

You do not need to integrate the **LearnPress** plugin manually with **Fluent Support** ; it happens automatically if the LearnDash plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased one course from **LearnPress** and the outline of course purchase history (Course Name, Graduation Progress, Enrollment Status, and Starting Date) has automatically appeared on his ticket.
