# MemberPress Integration


---

**MemberPress** is a **WordPress** plugin for creating and managing membership sites, ideal for monetizing content or building a website community. Integrating it with **Fluent Support** displays an overview of the **Course Purchase History** of any **User** , including the **User** **Status** and **Course Name** with **Status** (recurring or not) on the **Ticket** **Entries** page.

This article will guide you through integrating [**MemberPress**](https://memberpress.com/) with [**Fluent Support**](https://fluentsupport.com/).

## **MemberPress Purchase Information In Your Ticket** #

You will only see **MemberPress** information in a ticket**if the user has enrolled** in any **courses** **from MemberPress**.

You **do not need to integrate** the **MemberPress** plugin **manually** **with** **Fluent** **Support** ; it happens automatically if the MemberPress plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased three courses from **MemberPress** , and the overview of course purchase history (User Status and Course Name with Status) automatically appeared on his ticket.

This is how the integration of **MemberPress** with **Fluent Support** works!
