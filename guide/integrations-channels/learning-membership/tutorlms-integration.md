# TutorLMS Integration


---

**TutorLMS** is a great **WordPress** **LMS** free plugin, with all the necessary features to create, manage, and sell e-learning courses. **Fluent Support** integrates with **Tutor LMS** to display an overview of the **Course Purchase History** of any user, including the **Course Name** and **Enrollment Status** on the **Ticket Entries** page after a user purchases.

This article will guide you through integrating [**TutorLMS**](https://www.themeum.com/product/tutor-lms/) with [**Fluent Support**](https://fluentsupport.com/).

## **Tutor LMS Purchase Information In Your Ticket** #

You do not need to integrate the **TutorLMS** plugin manually with **Fluent Support** ; it happens automatically if the TutorLMS plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased a course from **TutorLMS** and the outline of course purchase history (Course Name and Enrollment Status) has automatically appeared on his ticket.
