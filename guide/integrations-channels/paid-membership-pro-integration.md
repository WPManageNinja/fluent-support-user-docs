# Paid Membership Pro Integration


---

**Paid Memberships Pro** is a popular free membership/subscription plugin for **WordPress**. **Fluent Support** integrates with **Paid Memberships Pro** to display an overview of the **Membership** details of a user, including the **Membership Level** and **Membership Starting Date** on the **Ticket Entries** page, who purchases this plugin.

This article will guide you through integrating [**Paid Memberships Pro**](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/) with [**Fluent Support**](https://fluentsupport.com/).

## **Paid Memberships PRO Purchase Information In Your Ticket** #

You do not need to integrate the **Paid Memberships Pro** plugin manually with **Fluent Support** ; it happens automatically if the Paid Memberships Pro plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased the **Paid Memberships Pro** plugin, and the outline of his membership details (Membership Level and Membership Starting Date) has automatically appeared on his ticket.
