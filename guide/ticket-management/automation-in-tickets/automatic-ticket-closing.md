### **Inactive Days For Tickets That You Want to Close Automatically** #

Set inactive days for tickets that you want to close automatically. As you can see, I set 15 days i.e., it will search for tickets which are not been updated for the last 15 days. You can set your value that is appropriate for your workflow.
