# Ticket Display Settings

This guide explains how to use the **Display Settings** feature to customize how tickets appear in your dashboard. These options allow you to choose which information is visible at a glance and how much space each ticket occupies on your screen.

## Accessing Display Settings

To open these options, navigate to the **Tickets** page from your dashboard. Look for the **Display Settings icon** (two vertical bars) located next to the sort icon on the top right side of the ticket list.

## Layout Types

You can choose between two different layouts based on how much information you want to see:

* **Default:** This uses standard spacing, making the ticket list easy to read with a clean look.
* **Compact:** This minimizes the spacing between tickets to provide maximum visibility, allowing you to see more tickets on a single page.
