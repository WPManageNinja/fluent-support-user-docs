# Advanced Filter Save Search Feature


---

Fluent Support makes it easy to save your advanced filtered searches for tickets. Instead of setting up the same filters repeatedly, you can create a custom filter once, save it, and apply it anytime with just one click.

In this article, we’ll guide you through the simple steps to save your advanced filtered search.

## **Save Search Feature** #

First, go to Fluent Support and click on **Tickets** in the navbar to view all your tickets. Next, enable the **Advanced Filter** option by toggling it on.

Create your advanced search using the available conditions and options. To learn more about the Advanced Filter options, check out this [article](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/advanced-filter-fluent-support/).

Once you’re done, click the **Save Search** button to save the filter for future use.

A pop-up will appear on the left side of your screen, showing all your saved searches. Here just click on any Saved search to filter your results. 

To modify a saved search, click the pencil icon next to it, and to delete a saved search, click the delete icon next to its name. If you want to close the pop-up, simply click the **Close** button.
