# Advanced Filter Save Search Feature

Fluent Support makes it easy to save your advanced filtered searches for tickets. Instead of setting up the same filters repeatedly, you can create a custom filter once, save it, and apply it anytime with just one click.

In this article, we’ll guide you through the simple steps to save your advanced filtered search.

## Save Search Feature

First, go to Fluent Support and click on **Tickets** in the navbar to view all your tickets. Next, enable the **Advanced Filter** option by toggling it on.

Create your advanced search using the available conditions and options. To learn more about the Advanced Filter options, check out this [article](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/advanced-filter-fluent-support/).

Once you’re done, click the **Save Search** button to save the filter for future use.
