## Set Conditions #

To learn **how to set conditions** for advanced filtering, follow the steps with the screenshots below —

Once you click on the **\+ Add** or **\+ And** button, you will see a box with a dropdown.

![+ Add or + And button](public/images/ticket-management/search-filter/advanced-filter-fluent-support/and-or-add-box-set-conditions-scaled-1.webp)

In this box, you will get a **List of Default Conditions** based on the value that you’ve selected.

For example, in the screenshot you can see, I selected the “**Ticket Created** ” item under the “**Tickets”** property and I got the default conditions list. Now I can set any one of the conditions according to needs.

You can **set any conditions** from the given list according to your needs by using the **Dropdown** option as well.

For example, here I select the **Ticket** property, the **Title** item (where I put “**Fluent** **Form** ” as value), and then the Includes condition. In this case, the filtering includes only those tickets that have Fluent Form words inside their title and appear on my ticket dashboard.

By following the same process, you set as many conditions as you want to filter your tickets.
