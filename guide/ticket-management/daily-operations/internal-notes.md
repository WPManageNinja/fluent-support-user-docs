# Internal Notes


---

“**Internal Notes** ” are private notes about users that only support agents can see. This feature promotes better team collaboration for faster ticket resolution (e.g., you can leave notes for colleagues to continue conversations if you’re stuck in the middle of a conversation at the end of your shift). This article explains the functionality of this feature in **[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/)**.

To learn how to add the **Internal** **Notes** inside a specific ticket, follow the steps with the screenshots & GIFs below —

First, go to **Tickets** under **Fluent Support** **Dashboard** & **open your desired ticket** and this will take you to the **ticket entry page**.
