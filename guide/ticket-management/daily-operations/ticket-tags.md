This article will guide you through the process of using the ”**Tags”** feature of **[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/)** so that you can easily create **Tags** that can help you categorize the tickets and assign certain tags to mark any tickets.

For instance, I edited the **Title** from ‘Fluent Support’ to ‘Fluent Support PRO’. Similarly, you can **Edit/Delete** any of your products according to your needs.
