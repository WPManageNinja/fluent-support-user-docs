**[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/)** allows you to **Merge** multiple tickets into a single ticket from a single user with all responses included especially to remove the need for separate replies. This article will guide you through the whole process of doing it.

## Merge Tickets #

To learn how you can **Merge** **Tickets** using **Fluent Support** , follow the steps with the screenshots & GIFs below —

Remember, only those with [**permission**](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/permission-management-for-agents/) can merge tickets. Also, once you merge all tickets, you can’t **Unmerge** them.

First, go to your **Fluent Support** and click on **Tickets.**

Now go to your desired ticket section from **My Tickets, All Tickets** , **Unassigned** , or **Bookmarks**.
