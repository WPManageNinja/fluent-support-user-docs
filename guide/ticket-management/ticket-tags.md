# Ticket Tags (Custom Tags)


This article will guide you through the process of using the ”**Tags”** feature of Fluent Support so that you can easily create **Tags** that can help you categorize the tickets and assign certain tags to mark any tickets.

## How To Create Tags

Go to your Fluent Support **Dashboard** & click on **Global Settings.**

Also, you can **edit/delete** the tags by clicking the **Pencil/Trash** icons on the right-hand side under the **Actions** column.

For instance, I edited the **Title** from ‘Fluent Support’ to ‘Fluent Support PRO’. Similarly, you can **Edit/Delete** any of your products according to your needs.
