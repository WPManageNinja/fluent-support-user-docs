# Merge Tickets

Fluent Support allows you to **Merge** multiple tickets into a single ticket from a **single user** with all responses included especially to remove the need for separate replies. This article will guide you through the whole process of doing it.

## Merge Tickets

Remember, only those with [**permission**](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/permission-management-for-agents/) can merge tickets. Also, once you merge all tickets, you can’t **Unmerge** them.

First, go to your **Fluent Support** and click on **Tickets.**

Now go to your desired ticket section from **My Tickets, All Tickets** , **Unassigned** , or **Bookmarks**.

Open the specific ticket you want to merge, and click on the **Three dot Icon**. Now, select ”**Merge Tickets”** and a popup page will appear on the top.

The popup will display all the tickets opened by a single user under **ID** , **Title** , and **Status** options to merge.

You can select all the tickets in bulk at once or individually based on your needs. Then click on the **Merge** button.

Click on and the ticket will be combined with the previous one. Now you can respond to all merged tickets at once with a single response for all inquiries.
