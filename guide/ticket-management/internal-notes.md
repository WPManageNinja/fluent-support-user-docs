# Internal Notes

**Internal Notes** are private notes about users that only support agents can see. This feature promotes better team collaboration for faster ticket resolution (e.g., you can leave notes for colleagues to continue conversations if you’re stuck in the middle of a conversation at the end of your shift). This article explains the functionality of this feature in Fluent Support.

## How to Add Internal Notes 

To learn how to add the **Internal Notes** inside a specific ticket, follow the steps with the screenshots below —

First, go to **Tickets** under **Fluent Support** **Dashboard** & **open your desired ticket** and this will take you to the **ticket entry page**.

Now, click on the **Notes** button at the top and this will open a text editor where you can add the notes about your users for better ticket management.

**Here,** you will find the **Add Media** option where you can insert any media file within a note.  
Or, upload an external file using the **Browse Files** button.

You can ask **AI** for your internal note suggestions. Simply click on the AI button and AI will give you the internal note suggestion. 

You can also use templated replies by clicking on the **Templates** button. It allows you to search for a saved reply using the search box.
