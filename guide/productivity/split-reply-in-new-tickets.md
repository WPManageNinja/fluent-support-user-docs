**[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/)** allows you to **Split** any reply into a new ticket i.e. if a customer raises a new issue in an ongoing ticket, you can separate the conversation and create a new ticket, and the separate tickets will appear on both the customer & support ends. This article will guide you through the whole process of doing it.
