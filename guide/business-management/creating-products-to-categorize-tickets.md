Also, you can **Edit/Delete** the products by clicking the **Pencil/Trash** icons placed on the right-hand side under the **Actions** column.

For instance, I **edited** the Product **Title** from **‘Fluent Support’** to **‘Fluent Support PRO’**. Similarly, you can **Edit/Delete** any of your existing products according to your needs.
