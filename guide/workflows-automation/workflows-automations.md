# Workflows & Automations

A **Workflow/Automation** is a sequence of tasks that can be done either **Manually** or **Automatically** using certain triggers and conditions so that you can avoid performing the same actions repeatedly. You can easily create a workflow in **Fluent Support** as it has its **own workflow system.** This article will guide you through the process required to create workflows in Fluent Support.
