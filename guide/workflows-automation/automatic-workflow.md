# Automatic Workflow


---

A [**Workflow/Automation**](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/workflows-automations/) is a sequence of tasks that can be done [**Manually**](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/manual-workflow/) or **Automatically** using certain triggers and conditions to avoid performing the same actions repeatedly. This article will guide you through the process required to learn how to create**** the**Workflow Automatic** in **[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/).**

## Create An Automatic Workflow #

To learn how to create a new workflow automatically, follow the steps with screenshots below —

From the **Fluent Support Dashboard,** go to **Workflows** and click the **\+ Add New Workflow** button to create a new workflow.

Give a **Name** to your workflow**,** choose **Automatic** type, and click on the **Continue** button to create it.

Now choose a **Trigger** from the dropdown list to decide when your **Workflow** will run.

For example, if you choose the **On Ticket Creation** trigger, the Workflow will automatically run each time a ticket is created.

Then, you have to set a **Condition** that will trigger the **Workflow**. Multiple conditions can be set using the **+OR** and **+AND** options.

**You will get the following options to set the Condition for your Workflow –**

**Customer**

  * Customer First Name
  * Customer Last Name
  * Customer Email

**Message**

  * Ticket Title
  * Message Content
  * Attachments
  * Added Time Range
  * Added Date Range

**Ticket**

  * Ticket Priority (Client)
  * Selected Product
  * Mailbox

**Custom** **Fields**

  * Here, all of your existing custom fields will appear.

You can also **Delete** any existing condition by clicking the **Trash** **Icon**.

Now, set the **Action/s** (Task) from the dropdown list for **Workflow** to perform. Once you fill in all the necessary fields, click the **Save** button.

**You will get the following Actions from the Dropdown List –**

  * Add Response
  * Assign Agent
  * Add Internal Note
  * Close Ticket
  * Add Tag(s)
  * Remove Tag(s)
  * Delete Ticket
  * Block Ticket Submitter (customer)
  * Trigger Outgoing Webhook
  * Add Bookmarks
  * Remove Bookmarks
  * Change Mailbox

Multiple actions can be set if needed. To do this, click the **Add Another Action** button and follow the same process.

![Add multiple action](public/images/workflows-automation/automatic-workflow/set-multiple-actions-scaled-1.webp)

You can also **Delete** any existing action. To do this, expand the desired action by pressing it and then click the **Trash** **Icon**.

![Delete any existing action](public/images/workflows-automation/automatic-workflow/delete-actions-1.webp)

You can **change the name of your workflow** anytime from here as shown below.

Also, you can **set the sequence of your added workflow actions/tasks** using the **Drag and Drop Action** icon.

Once you set up the actions, **Publish** it by enabling the **Toggle** button at the top right corner to run the **Workflow**. Otherwise, it will be saved as a draft only.

To save any new changes always press the **Update Workflow** button right **next to the toggle**.

## See How Automatic Workflow Runs #

To see how **Automatic Workflow** runs in **Fluent Support Portal** follow the screenshots below —

For example, I set the **Trigger** as “**On Ticket Creation”** , **Condition** as “**Ticket Title that contains Refund word** ”**,** and **Action** as “**Add Bookmarks** ” in this **Workflow.**

Now, you can see that the **Ticket** shown in the screenshot below is **Automatically** **Bookmarked** after the **Creation** as it has the **Refund** word in the **Title.**

![Refund Ticket is bookmarked automatically ](public/images/workflows-automation/automatic-workflow/refund-ticket-scaled-1.webp)

You can easily get all of your bookmarked tickets under the **Bookmarks** option placed in the left sidebar of Fluent Support’s **Tickets**.

![Tickets will be stored under Bookmarked section](public/images/workflows-automation/automatic-workflow/bookmarked-ticket-scaled-1.webp)

This is how you can create and run **Automatic Workflow** in **Fluent** **Support!**
