A [**Workflow/Automation**](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/workflows-automations/) is a sequence of tasks that can be done **Manually** or **[Automatically](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/automatic-workflow/)** using certain triggers and conditions to avoid performing the same actions repeatedly. This article will guide you through the process required to learn how to create**** the**Workflow Manually** in **[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/).**

## Create A Manual Workflow #

To learn how to create a new workflow manually, follow the steps with screenshots below —

From the **Fluent Support Dashboard,** go to **Workflows** and click the **\+ Add New Workflow** button to create a new workflow.

Now, set the **Action/s** (Task) from the dropdown list for **Workflow** to perform. Once you fill in all the necessary fields, click the **Save** button.

**You will get the following Actions from the Dropdown List –**

  * Add Response
  * Assign Agent
  * Add Internal Note
  * Close Ticket
  * Add Tag(s)
  * Remove Tag(s)
  * Delete Ticket
  * Block Ticket Submitter (customer)
  * Trigger Outgoing Webhook
  * Add Bookmarks
  * Remove Bookmarks
  * Change Mailbox

For example, here I chose the **Close Tickets** action. You can choose any option according to your needs.

Multiple actions can be set if needed. To do this, click the **Add Another Action** and follow the same process.

Once you set up the actions, **Publish** it by enabling the **Toggle** button at the top right corner to run the **Workflow**. Otherwise, it will be saved as a draft only.

To save any new changes always press the **Update Workflow** button **right** **next to the toggle**.
