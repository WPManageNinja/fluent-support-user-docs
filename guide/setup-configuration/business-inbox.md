# Business Inbox Initially

A **Business Inbox** in Fluent Support acts as a dedicated communication channel for a specific brand, department, or website. It serves as a central hub that captures incoming inquiries via web forms or email piping and converts them into organized support tickets.

By using Business Inboxes, you can manage multiple brands or departments from a single WordPress dashboard while keeping their data and workflows entirely separate. This allows you to assign specific agents to certain inboxes, use unique email addresses for different services (like `sales@` vs `support@`), and ensure customers receive replies from the correct identity.

Ultimately, it streamlines ticket routing, enhances team focus, and provides a professional, segmented support experience as your business scales.

## Creating A Business Inbox 

Initially , there is **No Need** to create a separate **Business Inbox** manually. A [**Web-based Business Inbox**](/guide/setup-configuration/web-based-settings-in-business-inbox) is created automatically when you frist provide all the necessary information to set up your support portal under the **Onboarding Dashboard** section.

This setup typically happens during the initial configuration of the plugin.

### Automatic Creation via Onboarding Wizard

When you first install Fluent Support, the **Onboarding Wizard** guides you through the essential configurations.

 * **Business Information:** You will be asked to enter your **Business Name** and **Business Email**.
 * **Portal Page:** You will select or create a page for your support portal.
 * **Completion:** Once you click **Finish** and complete the wizard, your **Web-based Business** Inbox is automatically generated using the details you provided.

For a detailed guide on this process, please refer to the [Fluent Support Onboarding](/guide/getting-started/fluent-support-onboarding).

## Portal Configuration via Global Settings

If you skipped the wizard or need to reconfigure the initial setup, you can ensure your initial inbox and portal are set up correctly through the **Global Settings**.

 1. Go to **Settings** from your Fluent Support Dashboard and click on **Global Settings**.
 2. **Portal Page:** Select the page where you want your support portal to appear, or use the shortcode `[fluent_support_portal]` on a new page.
 3. **Save Settings:** Once you save these global settings, the system ensures your primary Web-based inbox is active and connected to this portal page.

For more details on configuring these options, please check the [Setup Customer Support Portal With Global Settings](/guide/setup-configuration/customer-support-portal-setup) documentation.
