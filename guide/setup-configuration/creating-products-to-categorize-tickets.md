**[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/)** , allows you to create multiple products for organizing your tickets and allows customers to select the relevant product when submitting their tickets. This article will help you through the process of creating products to categorize tickets.

## Creating Products 

First, go to your Fluent Support **Dashboard** & click on **Settings**. Next, select **Products** section from the left sidebar and click on **\+ Add New** button to create a new product.

You will successfully add product. Now, you can **Edit** the product by clicking the **Pencil** icons placed on the right-hand side under the **Actions** column and delete the product by clicking the **three-dots** icon.

For instance, I **edited** the Product **Title** from **‘Fluent Support’** to **‘Fluent Support PRO’**. Similarly, you can **Edit/Delete** any of your existing products according to your needs.
