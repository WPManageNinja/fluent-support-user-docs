# Adding Support Staff/Agents

Fluent Support allows you to add Agents/Staff to manage your tickets, as well as define specific **Permissions** and **Settings** for them. This article will guide you through the steps of adding new Support Staff/Agents and configuring their access levels.

## Add Support Staff/Agents

Go to **Settings** from your **Fluent Support Dashboard** and click on **Support Staff** from the left sidebar.

### Configuring Agent Information

In the pop-up window, you will need to fill in the following details:

* **Basic Information:** Enter the **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email**, and **Title** (Job Title, e.g., Support Staff, Developer).
* **Slack Integration:** If you use Slack notifications, enter the **Slack User ID** here.
* **Twilio Integration:** Enter a **WhatsApp Phone Number** if you are using Twilio integration.
* **Permissions:** Check the boxes to grant specific permissions. These are categorized into:
    * **Tickets Permissions:** (e.g., View Dashboard, Manage Own Tickets, Delete Tickets).
    * **Workflow Permissions:** (e.g., Manage Workflows).
    * **Settings:** (e.g., Manage Overall Settings).
    * **Reporting:** (e.g., View All Reports).
* **Restrictions:** You can check **Business Inbox Access Restriction** if you want to limit this agent to specific business inboxes.

Once you have filled in the necessary information and selected the permissions, click on the **Create** button to finish the process.
