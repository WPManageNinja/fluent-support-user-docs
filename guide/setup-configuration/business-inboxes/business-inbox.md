# Business Inbox 

---

**“Business Inboxes”** is an amazing feature of Fluent Support that manages support tickets from multiple businesses and their accounts according to your preferences. It allows you to group tickets by where they come from, such as your web portal or specific email addresses.

## Onboarding Dashboard (Initial Setup)

>[!Note]
> **Initially** , there is **No** **Need** to create a separate **Business** **Inbox** manually. A [**Web-based** **Business Inbox**](/guide/setup-configuration/business-inboxes/web-based-settings-in-business-inbox) is created automatically when you frist provide all the necessary information to set up your support portal under the **Onboarding Dashboard** section.

During the initial plugin setup (Onboarding):
 * You will fill out the necessary information to set up your Support Portal.
 * You will select a Page where you want the portal to appear, or allow the plugin to create a page automatically with the required shortcode.
 * Once you click **Continue** and finish the setup, your Support Portal connects to your WordPress site.

To learn about onboarding dashboard, read this full [Documentation](/guide/getting-started/fluent-support-onboarding).

The system will then automatically generate your primary **web-based** business inbox, ensuring you are ready to receive tickets immediately without manual configuration.

## Types of Business Inboxes

There are generally two types of business inboxes you can manage:

 * **Web-Based:** This is typically your default inbox (marked as DEFAULT) where tickets submitted directly through your customer support portal are stored.
 * **Email-Based:** These inboxes collect tickets created via email forwarding. You can have multiple email-based inboxes for different departments (e.g., Sales, General Support) or different brands.

## How To Create A New Business Inbox 

To learn how to set up the support portal to create the initial Business Inbox, follow the steps with the screenshots below —

## Access the Business Inbox

To view and manage your inboxes, navigate to the **Business Inboxes** tab from the top menu bar of your Fluent Support dashboard.

Here, you will see an overview of all your active inboxes presented as cards. Each card displays the Inbox Name, Email, Type, Ticket Count, and a Settings button.

To create a new inbox, you can simply click the **+ Add New Business Box** button located in the top right corner.

Select the **Page** from the **Dropdown menu** where you want to set up your **Support** **Portal**. Copy the **Shortcode** provided below and paste it on the selected page.
You can **Paste** the **Shortcode** anywhere on any **Page** of your **WordPress** **Site** according to your preference.

Or, you can simply enable the **create a page automatically with the shortcode** button to create a **Separate** **Page** for setting up your support portal **automatically**.

However, if you want to set up your support portal on a specific page or block of your website, ignore the automatic option and follow the instructions given above in the drop-down menu option. 

After entering all the necessary information, click on the **Continue** button.  
Your Support Portal will then be connected to your WordPress Site, and an automatic business inbox will also be created.
