Read the article accordingly to understand what these settings do.
## Web-Based Settings of Business Inbox #

**Hide Badge in Tickets**  
The Business Inbox Badge is an automatically generated label that appears next to a ticket’s title in the main ticket list. Its purpose is to provide a quick visual indicator of which Business Inbox (i.e., which support channel or product) the ticket belongs to. 
Fluent Support creates this badge by using a short abbreviation from the name of the specific Business Inbox that received the ticket. For example, a ticket submitted to your “Automation Support” inbox might display an **`Aut.`**. badge.
To hide the badge from the ticket, just need to enable the **`Hide Badge in Tickets`** button

Always press **Save Settings** after finishing all the customization in your **Inbox Settings** to save it, otherwise, changes will not appear in your inbox.
### Email Settings #
In the **Email Settings,** you can select to whom and when the email notifications will be delivered. Additionally, you can also customize the content of the email as well. To know the details of **Email Settings** , follow the guidelines with screenshots given below —
You will see certain options are enabled by default which can be modified at any time, and can add more options for sending and receiving email notifications as well.
First, select any option you want to add, customize or modify. Then, click on the **Pencil Icon** and a pop-up box will appear where you can enable notifications and customize email settings.
> For instance, I selected the **Ticket Created (To Customer)** option to send email notifications right after a customer submits a support ticket; but, you can choose any option to suit your needs.
![Email Settings of web-based business inbox](public/images/setup-configuration/business-inboxes/web-based-settings-in-business-inbox/untitled-26-1.webp)
To enable this option, click on **Enable This Email Notification** and press **Save Settings** to send this email notification to customers.

Click on the **Send Attachments (Not Recommended)** button to attach files to your email notifications.
**Why is this button suggested as (Not Recommended)?**  
Sometimes when you attach any files to your email, it may face some delivery failure.  
To avoid this situation and ensure that any kind of email is delivered without any hassle, we recommend using the **[FluentSMTP](https://fluentsmtp.com/)** plugin. To learn the basic use of the **FluentSMTP** plugin, check this [**Documentation**](https://fluentsmtp.com/docs-category/getting-started/).
![Send Attachments \(Not Recommended\)](public/images/setup-configuration/business-inboxes/web-based-settings-in-business-inbox/send-attachments.webp)
You can customize the subject name and body content of your email using the **Email Subject** field and **Email Body** box.
Also use the **shortcodes** from the **Available** **Smartcodes** list within the Email body or subject which will dynamically fetch various information like the Customer name, email, ticket ID, etc.
![Customize your email subject & body using shortcode](public/images/setup-configuration/business-inboxes/web-based-settings-in-business-inbox/customize-your-email-content.webp)
Always press**Save Settings** after finishing all the customization in your emails to save it, otherwise changes will not appear in your emails.
### Set as Default #
