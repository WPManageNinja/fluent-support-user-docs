## Ticket Form Settings 

You will find different settings options in Ticket Form Settings to customize your Ticket Form. These are —

  * Knowledge base suggestion on ticket creation form

  * Disable Rich Text Editor for Frontend
  * Required fields for products and services
  * Who can access customer portal?
  * WooCommerce Support Navigation
  * Form Labels Customization

To learn how to configure these settings, follow the detailed steps below.

#### Knowledge base suggestion 

Enable this setting so that your customers receive instant solution suggestions from related posts, docs, or products on your website when they type a subject.

  * **Enable knowledge base suggestion:** Check this box to activate the feature.
  * **Knowledge Base Post Types:** Select the source of your articles (e.g., post, attachment, product). You can choose various options like **Post** , **Attachment** , **Product** , **[Docs](/integrations-channels/other/betterdocs-integration)** , etc. based on your website content as suggestions.
  * **Suggested Articles Limit:** Define how many suggestions should appear (e.g., 5).

#### Disabled Default Fields 

This setting allows you to hide specific default fields from the ticket creation form if they are not relevant to your support flow. You can disable:

  * **File Upload:** Remove the attachment option.
  * **Priority:** Prevent users from setting their own priority level.
  * **Product & Services:** Hide the product selection dropdown.

#### Product & Service Field Requirement

  * **Mark product and service fields as required:** If you enable this, customers strictly must select a product or service before they can submit a ticket.

#### Rich Text Editor Option

  * **Disable Rich Text Editor for Frontend:** Check this box if you want to provide a simple plain-text area for the ticket description, removing formatting options (bold, italics, links, etc.) for the user.

#### Who can access customer portal? 

This setting gives you the option to select who can get access to your customer support portal. It provides two basic options and these are —

  * **Any logged in users:** If you enable this option, any user can get access by logging into the customer portal.
  * **Only selected user roles:** Here, you can specify which users can access your customer portal by selecting their roles (e.g., if you select Author, Contributor, and Customer roles, only they will have access).

#### WooCommerce Support Navigation

If you are using WooCommerce, this setting integrates Fluent Support directly into your store's account area.

  * **Add support link to WooCommerce account navigation:** Enable this to automatically add a "Support" tab to the WooCommerce "My Account" page menu, allowing customers to open tickets directly from their account dashboard.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have already integrated **Woocommerce** with your **Fluent** **Support** , you will get the setting shown in below. Otherwise, this setting option will not appear in your **Ticket** **Form** **Settings**.

  * **Subject heading:** (Default: Topic)
  * **Form content heading:** (Default: Ticket Details)
  * **Content help message:** (Default: Please provide details about your problem)
