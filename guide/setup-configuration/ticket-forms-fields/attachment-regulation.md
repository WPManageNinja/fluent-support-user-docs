Scroll down to the “**Accepted File Types”.** Here, you will find the types of files that are supported for submitting/replying to any ticket.  
These accepted file types are –

  * Photos
  * CSV
  * PDF/Docs
  * Zip
  * JSON
  * You also have the option to set the **Max File Size (In Megabytes)** and **Max File Upload** limit.

If you want you can add more **Attachment** **Types** using **Shortcode** if needed. To learn how to add Attachment Types, check this [**Documentation**](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/add-more-attachments-type/).

> To ensure all attachments are properly organized, Fluent Support automatically creates a dedicated folder for each support ticket when a file is first uploaded. This means all attachments related to a single ticket are kept together.
> 
> **Where are these folders stored?**
> 
> The storage location depends on your Fluent Support configuration:
> 
>   * **Default Storage (Local):** By default, these ticket-specific folders are created within your WordPress site’s local storage (in the `wp-content/uploads/fluent-support` directory), using the unique ticket ID as the folder name.
>   * **Third-Party Storage Integrations:** If you have configured an external storage integration (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), Fluent Support will create these same individual folders on that connected cloud service instead. All attachments for a ticket will then be stored directly in their corresponding folder on the integrated platform.
