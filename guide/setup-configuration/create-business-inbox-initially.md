# Create Business Inbox Initially


---

**“Business Inboxes”** is another amazing feature of ****Fluent Support**** which manages support tickets from multiple businesses and their accounts according to your preferences. This article helps you learn how to create the initial **Business Inbox** right after installing and activating the ******[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/)****** plugin.

## How To Create A New Business Inbox Initially 


**Initially** , there is **No** **Need** to create a **Separate** **Business** **Inbox** , because a [**Web-based** **Business Inbox**](/guide/setup-configuration/web-based-settings-in-business-inbox) will be created automatically when you provide all the necessary information to set up your support portal under the **Dashboard** section.


To learn how to set up the support portal to create the initial Business Inbox, follow the steps with the screenshots below —

Go to **Fluent Support** and click on **Dashboard**

Select the **Page** from the **Dropdown menu** where you want to set up your **Support** **Portal**. Copy the **Shortcode** provided below and paste it on the selected page.
You can **Paste** the **Shortcode** anywhere on any **Page** of your **WordPress** **Site** according to your preference.

Or, you can simply enable the **create a page automatically with the shortcode** button to create a **Separate** **Page** for setting up your support portal **automatically**.

However, if you want to set up your support portal on a specific page or block of your website, ignore the automatic option and follow the instructions given above in the drop-down menu option. 

After entering all the necessary information, click on the **Continue** button.  
Your Support Portal will then be connected to your WordPress Site, and an automatic business inbox will also be created.
