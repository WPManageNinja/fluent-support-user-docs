# Personal Reports

The ‘**Personal Reports**’ section displays the ticket statistics and performance data specific to you as a logged-in support agent. This report is private to you and helps you track your individual productivity.

## Accessing Personal Reports

To view your report, go to the **Reports** tab in the dashboard menu and select **Personal Reports** from the left side.

## Dashboard Overview 

This section is divided into three key areas:

1. **Quick Stats:** At the very top, you get an instant summary of your current workload, including **Total Replies**, **New Tickets**, **Closed Tickets**, **Responses**, and **Open Tickets**.
2. **My Statistics:** A large graph visualizes your activity over time. You can toggle between **Resolve Stats** (how many tickets you closed) and **Response Stats** (how many replies you sent).
3. **My Performance:** On the right, a dedicated performance box tracks your efficiency metrics, such as:
    * **Interactions:** Total touchpoints with customers.
    * **Waiting Tickets:** Number of tickets currently awaiting your reply.
    * **Average Waiting:** The average time a customer waits for your response.
    * **Max Waiting:** The longest time a customer has waited.

> [!TIP]
> You can use the **Date Filter** in the top right corner to view your performance for a specific time range.
