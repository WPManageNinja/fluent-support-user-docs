The **“Activities”** is another awesome feature of ****[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/)**** that lets you keep track of the overall ticket activities of your Support Agents. This article will give you a detailed overview of the dashboard in the **“Activities”** feature.

## An Overview of Activities #

You will find the “**Activities”** option from the top-right menu on your dashboard. This will display a timeline of overall activities (who created, replied to, or closed any ticket) in your support portal.

  * In this section, you can utilize the **Date** filter to view ticket statistics for a specific period.
  * Also, you can use the **All Support Stuff** filter to select the individual agent’s ticket statistics you want to view.
  * There, you will find a **Refresh** icon in the top right corner, use it to update ticket activity.

Also, whenever an agent assigns a ticket, it will be displayed in the overall activities.
