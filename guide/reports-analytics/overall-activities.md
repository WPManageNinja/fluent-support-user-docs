# Overall Activities

The **“Activities”** is another awesome feature of Fluent Support that lets you keep track of the overall ticket activities of your Support Agents. This article will give you a detailed overview of the dashboard in the **Activities** feature.

## An Overview of Activities

You will find the **Activities** option in the top navigation menu of your dashboard. Clicking this opens the activity log, which is divided into two tabs: **Overall** and **AI Activities**.

### Overall Activities

The **Overall** tab shows a timeline of actions in your support portal, such as who created, replied to, deleted, or closed a ticket, in the order they happened.

 * **Filter by Agent:** You can use the **All Support Staff** dropdown menu to view ticket statistics for a specific agent.
 * **Filter by Date:** Use the **Date** filter to view activities within a specific time range.
 * **Refresh:** A Refresh button is located in the top right corner to update the activity feed instantly.

Also, whenever an agent assigns a ticket, it will be displayed in the overall activities.

### Activity Log Settings

You will find a **Settings** (Gear Icon) located next to the **Date filter** on the tabs. This allows you to configure how logs are handled.

In the Activity Log Settings, you have the following options:

 * **Automatically delete activity logs after days:** Enter a number (e.g., 14) to set how long logs should be kept before being automatically deleted.
 * **Disable Activity Logs:** Check this box if you do not want to track support agent activities at all.
 * **Open Ticket in New Tab:** Enable this option if you want ticket links within the activity log to open in a new browser tab.

After making any changes, ensure you click on the **Update Settings** button. Otherwise, the changes won’t appear.
