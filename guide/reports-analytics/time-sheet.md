# Time Sheet

The ‘Time Sheet’ provides a concise summary of activity, useful for tracking agent hours or daily output over a specific period.

## Accessing Time Sheet 

To view your report, go to the **Reports** tab in the dashboard menu and select **Time Sheet**.

## View Modes 

You can organize the timesheet data in three ways using the available tabs:

* **By Tickets:** Organizes activity data based on individual support tickets.
* **By Agents:** This is the **Default view**, organizing data by individual support staff.
* **By Customers:** Organizes data based on customer interactions.

## Agent Timesheet 

The table displays a daily breakdown for each agent over the selected date range. It shows the total hours or activity units logged for each day (e.g., 12 Dec, 13 Dec) and calculates a **Total** at the end of the row.

## Export 

To use this data for payroll or external reporting, simply click the **Export** button in the top right corner to download the timesheet.
