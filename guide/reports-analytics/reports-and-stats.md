# Reports and Stats


---

The **“Reports”** is an advanced statistical analytics and reporting feature of ******[Fluent Support](https://fluentsupport.com/)******. It provides an accurate view of the entire team’s performance and even allows you to track and measure the performance of individual support executives. This article will give you a focused overview of the dashboard in the **“Reports”** feature.

## Reports #

You will find the “**Reports”** option from the top-left menu on your Fluent Support’s **Dashboard**. This will display **Five** different sections of ticket statistics and reports. These are:

  * Personal Reports
  * Agents Reports
  * Products Reports
  * Business Boxes Reports
  * Activity Reports

In **each Report’s section** except Activity Reports, you’ll find a **Bar Chart** displaying **Overall Ticket Activity** statistics.  
  
And, the **‘Current Overall’** section under the **‘Agents Reports Summary’** tab displays all statistics on an **hourly** basis e.g., **average waiting time** , **response rates** , **interactions** , etc. It’s effective for managing a large number of daily tickets.
