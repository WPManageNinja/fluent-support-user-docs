# Reports and Stats

The **“Reports”** is an advanced statistical analytics and reporting feature of Fluent Support. It provides an accurate view of the entire team’s performance and even allows you to track and measure the performance of individual support executives. 

This article will give you a focused overview of the dashboard in the **“Reports”** feature.

## Accessing Reports

To access your analytics dashboard, simply click on the **Reports** tab located in the top navigation menu of your **Fluent Support Dashboard**.

This will open the reporting hub, which is divided into **six** distinct sections, each designed to provide a specific type of insight:


  **1. [Personal Reports](/guide/reports-analytics/personal-report):** This section is designed for individual agents to track their own progress. It displays personal statistics, resolution rates, and response metrics, allowing agents to monitor their own efficiency.

  **2. [Agents Reports](/guide/reports-analytics/agents-report):** This section provides a bird's-eye view of the entire support team. Supervisors can compare performance across different agents and view aggregate data to ensure the team is meeting its goals.

  **3. [Products Reports](/guide/reports-analytics/products-reports):** This report breaks down support volume by **Product**. It helps you identify which products generate the most support tickets, allowing you to pinpoint potential issues or documentation gaps.

  **4. [Business Boxes Reports](/guide/reports-analytics/business-boxes-reports):** This section analyzes ticket traffic based on your various **Business Inboxes** (e.g., Web Portal vs. Email Support). It helps you understand which communication channels are utilizing the most resources.

  **5. [Activity Reports](/guide/reports-analytics/activity-reports):** The Activity Report visualizes support trends. It typically uses heat maps to highlight peak hours and days, helping you understand when your team is most active and when staffing adjustments might be needed.

  **6. [Time Sheet](/guide/reports-analytics/time-sheet):** The Time Sheet offers a concise, tabular summary of activity logs. It allows you to view agent activity by date, making it a useful tool for tracking work hours or daily output for payroll and management purposes.
