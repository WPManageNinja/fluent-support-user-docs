# Business Boxes Reports

The **Business Boxes Reports** section analyzes support traffic based on your different input channels (Business Inboxes). This is useful if you manage multiple brands or departments (e.g., Sales vs. Support) from a single dashboard.

## Accessing Business Boxes Reports

Navigate to the **Reports** tab and click on **Business Boxes Reports**.

## Overview

* **Quick Stats:** Shows the total activity across all selected inboxes.
* **Business Box Statistics:** A bar chart displaying ticket volume trends over time for your inboxes.

## Business Box Summary

The summary table lists each active mailbox (e.g., Email Based, Web-based, FS TEST). It provides a clear breakdown of:

* **Responses:** How many replies were sent from this inbox?
* **Interactions:** Total activity count.
* **Open Tickets:** Number of active tickets in this specific inbox.
* **Closed:** Total resolved tickets for this inbox.
