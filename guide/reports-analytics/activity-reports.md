# Activity Reports

The ‘Activity Reports’ section shows the overall report of all ticket statistics and summaries using a **heat map visualization** based on customers' and agents' activities. This provides a visual representation of when your support system is busiest.

## Accessing Activity Reports

To access the activity reports, navigate to the **Reports** tab from the top menu and select **Activity Reports**.

## Activity Trends by Time of Day

This section visualizes activity levels throughout the week using a grid system:

* **Grid Structure:** The grid maps days of the week (Mon-Sun) against hours of the day (01 am to 10 pm).
* **Heat Map Indicators:** The color intensity represents the volume of activity:
    * **Light Green:** Represents fewer activities.
    * **Dark Green:** Represents more activities (peak times).

## Filtering Options

You can customize the data displayed in the heat map using several filters available at the top right of the chart:

* **Response Type Filter:** You can choose to view statistics for **All Tickets**, **Agent Response**, or **Customer Response**.
* **Agent Filter:** When viewing "Agent Response," you can further filter by **All Agents** or select a specific agent from the dropdown list to see their individual activity patterns.
* **Date Filter:** Use the date picker to view ticket activity trends for a specific period.
