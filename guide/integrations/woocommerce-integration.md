**WooCommerce** is a customizable, open-source eCommerce platform for **WordPress** that allows support agents to view the **purchase** **history** of any WooCommerce product user and allows customers to open tickets through Fluent Support for issues related to specific WooCommerce products or orders.

This article will guide you through integrating [**WooCommerce**](https://woocommerce.com/) with [**Fluent Support**](https://fluentsupport.com/).

## **WooCommerce Integration With FluentSupport** #

To integrate WooCommerce into Fluent Support, follow the steps with screenshots below —

You don’t need to perform any integration yourself. It will happen automatically if the **WooCommerce** plugin is already installed on your site.

### **WooCommerce Product Information in your Ticket** #

If you click on the **Product ID** under a specific ticket, a pop-up will appear that includes all the information about the product purchase.

To get the product information in your tickets as shown in the screenshot below, you must **Create Custom Fields** in your **Fluent Support** site for **WooCommerce**.
