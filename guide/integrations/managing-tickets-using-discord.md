**[FluentSupport](https://fluentsupport.com/)** can send notifications for your Tickets to Discord. This article will guide you through the whole process. 

## **Fluent Support Discord Settings** 

Go to the **Global** **Settings** from the Fluent Support **Dashboard** and select **Notification** **Integrations** from the left sidebar to find the **Discord** option.

You will see the **Discord Integration Settings** page where you will see that a **Webhook** **URL** is needed to get the notifications.

Also, you will get the **Notification** **Events** which allow you to choose what kind of notifications you want for your Tickets. Just select the checkbox to enable the notification option.

Once you provide the **Webhook** **URL** and set your **Notifications** **Events** , do not forget to click on **Save** **Discord Settings**.
