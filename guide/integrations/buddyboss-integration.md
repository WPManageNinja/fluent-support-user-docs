# BuddyBoss Integration

[Original Documentation](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/buddyboss-integration/)

---

BuddyBoss is an open-source solution for building online communities with less time and effort. Fluent Support integrates BuddyBoss to display an overview of a user’s BuddyBoss group information, including **Group Name** and **Joining Date** on the **Ticket Entries** page after a user purchases this plugin.

This article will guide you through integrating [**BuddyBoss**](https://www.buddyboss.com/) with [**Fluent Support**](https://fluentsupport.com/).

## **BuddyBoss Purchase Information In Your Ticket** #

You do not need to integrate the **BuddyBoss** plugin manually with **Fluent Support** ; it happens automatically if the BuddyBoss plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased the **BuddyBoss** plugin and the outline of his group information (Group Name and Joining Date) has automatically appeared on his ticket.

This is how the integration of **BuddyBoss** with **Fluent Support** works!
