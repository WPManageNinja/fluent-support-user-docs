> [!Note]
> You do not need to perform any manual integration steps. The connection happens automatically if the Easy Digital Downloads (EDD) plugin is already installed and active on your site.

## EDD Product Information in Tickets

Once integrated, support agents can easily verify purchase details while viewing a ticket.

For example, when a support agent clicks on the **Eye Icon** next to the product price within the ticket view, a pop-up will appear displaying the user’s detailed EDD purchase history.
