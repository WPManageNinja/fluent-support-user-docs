# LifterLMS Integration


---

**LifterLMS** is a powerful **WordPress LMS** plugin to easily create, sell, and secure engaging online courses and training-based membership websites. **Fluent Support** integrates with **Lifter LMS** to display an overview of the **Course Purchase History** of any user, including the **Course Name** and **Enrollment Status** on the **Ticket Entries** page after a user purchases.

This article will guide you through integrating [**LifterLMS**](https://lifterlms.com/) with **Fluent Support**.

## **LifterLMS Purchase Information In Your Ticket** #

You do not need to integrate the **LifterLMS** plugin manually with **Fluent Support** ; it happens automatically if the LifterLMS plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased two courses from **LifterLMS** and the outline of course purchase history (Course Name and Enrollment Status) has automatically appeared on his ticket.
