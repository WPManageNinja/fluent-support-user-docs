# LearnDash Integration

[Original Documentation](https://fluentsupport.com/docs/learndash-integration/)

---

**LearnDash** is a worldwide trusted **WordPress LMS** plugin for creating (and selling) their online courses. **Fluent Support** integrates with **LearnDash** to display an overview of the **Course Purchase History** of any user, including the **Course Name** and **Enrollment Status** on the **Ticket Entries** page after a user purchases.

This article will guide you through integrating [**LearnDash**](https://www.learndash.com/learndash-lms/) with [**Fluent Support**](https://fluentsupport.com/).

## **LearnDash Purchase Information In Your Ticket** #

You do not need to integrate the **LearnDash** plugin manually with **Fluent Support** ; it happens automatically if the **LearnDash** plugin is already installed on your site.

For example, here you can see a user purchased three courses from **LearnDash Courses** and the overview of course purchase history (Course Name and Enrollment Status) has automatically appeared on his ticket.

This is how the integration of **LearnDash** with **Fluent** **Support** works!
