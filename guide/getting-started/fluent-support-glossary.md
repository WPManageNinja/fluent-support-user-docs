# Fluent Support Glossary

This glossary defines common terms used throughout the Fluent Support documentation to help you understand key features and concepts effectively.

## A

**Advanced Filters:** A powerful search tool within the dashboard that allows you to sort and locate specific tickets based on detailed parameters such as status, priority, agent, or date range.

**Agent:** A support staff member added to your Fluent Support system who has permission to view, reply to, and manage tickets. Also referred to as Support Staff.

**Agent Collision Detection:** A real-time feature that notifies an agent if another staff member is currently viewing or replying to the same ticket, preventing duplicate responses.

**Agent Time Tracking:** A feature that monitors and records the duration an agent spends working on a specific ticket, useful for performance analysis and billing.

**Activity Logs:** A detailed record of all actions taken within the helpdesk, such as ticket assignments, status changes, and replies, ensuring transparency and accountability.

**AI-Generated Replies:** An automated feature that uses Artificial Intelligence to draft responses based on the context of the ticket, helping agents reply faster.

**AI Ticket Summary:** A feature that automatically generates a concise summary of a long ticket conversation, allowing agents to catch up quickly without reading every message.

## B

**Bookmark Ticket:** An action that allows agents to save specific tickets for quick access later, useful for high-priority issues or complex cases requiring follow-up.

**Business Inbox:** A dedicated mailbox setup for a specific business or website managed within Fluent Support. You can add multiple Business Inboxes to manage support for different brands from a single dashboard.

## C

**Customer Portal:** A front-end dashboard where your customers can log in to submit new tickets, view their ticket history, and check the status of their inquiries. This portal can be customized to match your website's branding.

**Customer Profile:** A dedicated view containing all known information about a user, including their contact details, purchase history (via integrations), and previous support interactions.

**Custom Fields:** Additional data fields added to ticket forms to collect specific information from customers (e.g., "Order Number" or "Website URL") during submission.

## D

**Delay Tracking:** A metric that tracks the time elapsed between a customer's message and an agent's response, or how long a ticket has been in a "Waiting" state.

**Draft Mode:** A feature that automatically saves an agent's typed response as a draft, preventing data loss if the page is closed or refreshed before sending.

## E

**Email Piping:** A technology that connects your support email address to Fluent Support. When a customer sends an email to this address, it is automatically converted into a support ticket.

**Email Verification:** A security feature that requires customers to verify their email address before accessing their tickets, ensuring user authenticity.

## G

**Global Settings:** The central configuration area in the dashboard where you manage general options, email settings, file upload limits, and other system-wide preferences.

**Gutenberg Block:** A WordPress editor component that allows you to easily embed and customize the Customer Portal directly on any page of your website.

## I

**Incoming Webhook:** A mechanism that allows external applications to send data to Fluent Support, often used to create tickets automatically from other tools.

**Internal Note:** A private comment added to a ticket thread that is visible only to support agents and admins, not the customer. Used for team collaboration and context sharing.

## M

**Merge Tickets:** The process of combining multiple tickets from the same customer or regarding the same issue into a single ticket thread to streamline communication.

## O

**Outgoing Webhook:** A system that sends data from Fluent Support to external applications when specific events occur (e.g., when a ticket is closed), enabling automation with third-party tools.

## P

**Priority:** A status level assigned to a ticket (e.g., Normal, Medium, Critical) to indicate its urgency and help agents organize their workflow.

**Product:** In Fluent Support, this refers to a category or item you sell that can be linked to a ticket. This allows you to categorize support requests by specific products.

## R

**REST API:** A programmatic interface that allows developers to connect Fluent Support with other custom applications or systems to build advanced integrations.

## S

**Saved Replies:** Pre-written templates for frequently asked questions. Agents can insert these into their responses with a single click to save time.

**Silent Close:** An option to close a ticket without sending a notification email to the customer. This is useful for closing spam tickets or internal administrative tickets.

**Support Staff:** (See Agent).

## T

**Ticket:** The core unit of communication in Fluent Support. It represents a single support request or conversation thread between a customer and an agent.

**Ticket Importer:** A tool that allows you to migrate support data and ticket history from other helpdesk platforms (like Freshdesk or Help Scout) into Fluent Support.

**Ticket Status:** The current state of a ticket (e.g., New, Active, Closed, Pending). This helps track the progress of a support request.

**Ticket Tags:** Custom labels applied to tickets for organization and filtering purposes (e.g., "Bug Report," "Presale," "Billing").

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** An enhanced security layer that requires agents to provide a second form of verification (usually a code) in addition to their password when logging in.

## W

**Workflow:** An automation sequence that performs actions based on specific triggers and conditions. For example, "If a ticket contains the word 'Refund,' automatically assign it to the Billing Department."
