# Fluent Support Onboarding

Fluent Support is a WordPress plugin offering an efficient support ticketing system for fast, reliable, and effective customer support. After installing and activating the plugin, an onboarding wizard will guide you through the essential configurations to get your support portal running in minutes.

This article will guide you through the onboarding setup process on your WordPress website.

## Getting Started with the Setup Wizard

Once you have successfully installed and activated Fluent Support, you will be automatically redirected to the **Fluent Support Onboarding Wizard**. This multi-step process ensures your business details and support portal page are correctly configured from the start.

### Step 1: Business Information & Portal Page

The first screen of the wizard welcomes you and asks for basic business information. Follow these steps:

*  **Business Name:** Enter the name of your company or organization (e.g., Awesome Business Inc).
*  **Business Email:** Provide the primary email address for your support system.
*  **Support Portal Page:** You need a page where customers will view and manage their tickets. You can:
    * Select an existing page from the dropdown menu.
    * Check the box "**Create a page automatically with the shortcode**" to have Fluent Support create one for you.

> [!NOTE]
> The page must contain the shortcode `[fluent_support_portal]`.

Click the **Next Step** button to proceed.

The second step allows you to stay updated and help improve the plugin environment.

1.  **Newsletter:** You can enter your email address to subscribe to the Bi-Monthly newsletter for tips and advanced usage guides.
2.  **Share Essentials:** Check this box if you wish to allow Fluent Support to collect non-sensitive usage data to help improve the plugin.

This option enables Fluent Support to collect non-sensitive data, allowing us to improve features and fix bugs more efficiently.

You can choose "**Yes, Count me in!**" to opt-in or "**No Thanks**" to decline. No personal data is tracked or stored.
